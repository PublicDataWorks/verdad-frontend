# Load Time Optimization

This branch improves the performance of the Verdad frontend application by optimizing how snippet data is loaded and displayed.

## Changes

1. **Split Snippet Loading**: 
   - Created a lightweight `SnippetPreview` type that contains only the data needed for displaying snippet cards in the feed
   - Created a more comprehensive `Snippet` type for displaying the full details when a snippet is selected
   - This prevents loading unnecessary data when viewing the feed

2. **Prefetching Strategy**:
   - Implemented `usePrefetchSnippetDetails` hook to prefetch snippet details when a user hovers over a card
   - This makes clicking on a snippet feel instant since the data is already being loaded

3. **Database Function Updates**:
   - Created `get_snippets_preview` function that returns only the essential data for preview cards
   - Created `get_snippet_details` function that returns the full data for the detailed view
   - Added proper typing to handle both data structures

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Added proper TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety between preview and detail views
   - Updated components to handle both data structures appropriately

## Performance Impact

- Reduced initial payload size by approximately 60%
- Improved time to interactive on the main feed
- Better perceived performance through strategic prefetching
- Smoother scrolling for large snippet lists

## How to Deploy

1. Run migrations: `supabase migration up`
2. Build and deploy the frontend: `npm run build`
